Once upon a time there was a mountain, on the mountain there was a temple. In the temple there were two monks, one elderly and the other young.
One time there was this mountain which was big; upon it were two lonely monks.  One of them might be elderly, but the other was young. They were guards to the old temple to which no one should approach.
